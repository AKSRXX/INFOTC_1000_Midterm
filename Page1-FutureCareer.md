# My Future Career and Goals

## __My Current Position at MIZZOU__:


As of March 2022 I am a Junior at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I started my journey at MIZZOU as a Business Administration Major. 

I recently switched to Information Technology fall of 2021. I Obtained a Minor in business before switching to Information Technology.

I chose to not further my academics in business because the kind of job I wanted was not offered in that field. I was more interested in a job like

a software engineer which is my ideal career choice. I should be able to graduate from Mizzou in the summer of 2023.

## __What do I aim to Accomplish in My Ideal Career?__

I aim to accomplish a career that I can grow with and enjoy at the same time. I always enjoyed and had a knack to solving puzzles which is

offered in the Information Technology feild of study. Technology is the foundation of our society and will be a neccesity for generations to come.

Already in my limited time in the technology department I learned a great deal and enjoy every ounce of knowledge I gained. 

I aim to be a contributing factor to a large company and eventually use that knowledge to build my own business.
