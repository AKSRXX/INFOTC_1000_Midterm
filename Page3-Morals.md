## Introduction

My morals are based on how I veiw life through my experiences. They might not be as precize or complex as others 

but it is still able to define me.

## Discipline

In my youth I spent over 10 years with [ActivStars Karate](https://activstars.com/) . In that time I was able to have positive 

role models teach the importance of dicipline and respect of others.

## Work Ethic

My parents made sure from an early age that I would master the skill of knowing how to work and to work hard.

They owned a home renovation business and had me come in anytime I was not in school and prepare me for the work force.

I never appreciated what I learned from this experience until I got my first job at 16. I was prepared and had a mindset of

hard work from that point forward

## How I Treat Others

I treat others with respect and avoid conflicts with people. I do not like to argue with people and nor do I like people being mean or

disrespectful to me or others so I choose not to spread hate.  *Respect for ourselves guides our morals, respect for others guides our manners. -Laurence Sterne*
